SmartDriver
Creator: Pulak Surjit
Class: Class 7
School: DPS Greater Faridabad
 
Project Overview:
Problem Identified: Sleepiness accounts for as much as 6% of the car accidents caused in the world every year. Because of this, over 70,000 injuries and 1500 deaths happen.

Solution: An AI-driven solution to address drowsy driving through advanced machine learning algorithms. By leveraging Teachable Machine with Python, SmartDriver employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyse facial features in drivers.
 Upon detecting signs of drowsiness, the system autonomously activates hazard lights, initiates gradual vehicle deceleration, and triggers auditory alerts to awaken the driver, preventing potential accidents.

Innovative Use of AI Tools: SmartDriver uses AI technologies to enhance automotive safety. The project harnesses the capabilities of TensorFlow, a powerful machine learning framework, to train and deploy CNN models for real-time drowsiness detection. 
It uses a camera as its main input. 

Future Goals: Add a microcontroller like Arduino that will be able to control the hazard lights and stop the car according to the algorithmâ€™s response.

How It Is Used: A Camera will be placed on the driver's side of the IRVM thus giving an image of the driver. This image will be passed to a microcontroller which will analyse it and take action accordingly.

Learning Experience: The development of SmartDriver provided hands-on experience in implementing AI algorithms and IoT frameworks. Through the utilization of Teachable Machine, I gained proficiency in model training, optimization, 
and deployment, while also exploring data preprocessing and feature extraction for robust drowsiness detection. 

Certifications/Recognitions: None

Impact Created: SmartDriver represents a shift in automotive safety, offering a proactive solution to mitigate the risks associated with drowsy driving. By leveraging AI, IoT, and microcontroller technologies, 
SmartDriver not only enhances road safety but also promotes driver well-being and reduces the incidence of accidents, thereby contributing to the overarching goal of fostering sustainable transportation ecosystems.
