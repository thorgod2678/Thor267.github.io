        ⠀⠀How To Achieve SDG 1
    </a>
    <h1 style="color: yellow;">What are SDG's</h1>
    
    <p1 style="color: orange; font-size: larger;">
        Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global goals established by the United Nations in 2015 to address a wide range of social, economic, and environmental challenges. They were designed as a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for everyone by 2030. Each goal targets a specific area of development, such as ending poverty, improving health and education, reducing inequality, and tackling climate change. The SDGs build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) but are broader in scope and more ambitious, recognizing that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs, including education, health, social protection, and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and environmental protection.⠀⠀

        The SDGs aim to be inclusive, ensuring that no one is left behind. They emphasize the importance of global partnership and cooperation among governments, businesses, and civil society to achieve these goals. The goals are interconnected, meaning that progress in one area can influence and contribute to progress in others. For instance, improving education (Goal 4) can lead to better job opportunities and economic growth (Goal 8), which in turn can help reduce poverty (Goal 1). Each goal also includes specific targets and indicators to measure progress, making it easier for countries to track their advancements and identify areas needing more attention. By working together towards these goals, the international community aims to create a more equitable, prosperous, and sustainable world for current and future generations.
